# Help

To get help if you're having trouble, you can use one of the following resources:

- [/r/WebAssembly](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebAssembly/) is the WebAssembly subreddit.
- [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/exercism/wasm/issues) is where we track our development and maintenance of Javascript exercises in exercism. But if none of the above links help you, feel free to post an issue here.
